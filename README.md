# Welcome to my RRV7 CRUD App!

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) app that uses React Router 7, TailwindCSS for styling, Supabase for the backend and Fly for deployment.

This is part 1 of a series of projects I will be doing to learn RR7.

You can add, edit and delete items from the page. Enjoy!
